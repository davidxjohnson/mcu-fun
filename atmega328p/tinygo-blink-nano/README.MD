# tinygo-blink-nano

This "sketch" was created and executed using the Visual Studio Code and other related utilities et al that can be found at [tinygo.org](https://tinygo.org/docs/tutorials/blinky/) (Debian, Fedora, MacOS and Windows). This was tested on an Arduino Nano (atmega328p), but should work seemlessly on any of the TinyGo [supported boards](https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/microcontrollers/).

I observed that TinyGo compiled and flashed much faster than the Arduino IDE, as well as producing a much smaller binary.
